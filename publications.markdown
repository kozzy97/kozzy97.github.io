I have published on a wide range of topics in several different fields, all in the hope of one day conquering all the sub-fields of cognitive science. I do this not only for the thrill of dilettantism, but also because I harbour ambitions to understand cognition in all its forms: human, animal, and machine. One day I will get to bacteria, plants, and other life-forms too! 

Since I am on the job market and machine learning/AI is a best seller right now, we will start with my machine learning contributions:
- [Testing the Limits of Fine-Tuning for Improving Visual Cognition in Vision Language Models (2025)](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=jSxU7ZGe3B). *Accepted at ICML*. We find that the intuitive physics capabilities of fine-tuned VLMs is extraordinarily brittle and not very human-like.
- [PredictaBoard: Benchmarking LLM score predictability (2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14445?). *Accepted in ACL Findings*. We propose a novel benchmark for quantifying and comparing the *predictability* of LLM responses.
- [metabench-A Sparse Benchmark of Reasoning and Knowledge in Large Language Models (2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12844) *Accepted at ICLR*. We use Item Response Theory to distill six common benchmarks down to 3% of their original size, while preserving predictive accuracy.
- [Bringing comparative cognition approaches to AI systems (2025)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-025-00456-8). *Accepted in Nature Reviews Psychology*. We propose that AI Evaluation has a lot to learn from comparative cognition in terms of experimental design.
- [A little less conversation, a little more action, please: Investigating the physical common-sense of LLMs in a 3D embodied environment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23242?). *Under review*. We find that LLMs aren't very good at solving problems that are straightforward for humans and other animals.
- [The Animal-AI Environment: A Virtual Laboratory For Comparative Cognition and Artificial Intelligence Research (2024)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-025-02616-3). *Accepted in Behavior Research Methods*. We present the latest and greatest version of the [Animal-AI Environment](https://sites.google.com/csah.cam.ac.uk/animalai/), a tool for uniting comparative cognition and AI.
- [Inferring capabilities from task performance with bayesian triangulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11975). *Under review*. We propose a novel strategy for statistically inferring latent capabilities in machine learning models using instance-level behavioural data.
- [Evaluating Object Permanence in Embodied Agents using the Animal-AI Environment (2022)](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3169/paper2.pdf). *Accepted at EBeM Workshop @ IJCAI*. We present a benchmark for testing object permanence in agentic systems.
- [Direct Human-AI Comparison in the Animal-AI Environment (2022)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.711821). *Accepted in Frontiers in Psychology*. We directly compare children and deep reinforcement learning agents on cognitively-inspired tasks.


In cognitive psychology, I played a small part in:
- [A foundation model to predict and capture human cognition (2025)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09215-4). *Accepted in Nature*. We build the most predictive "model" of human decision-making ever seen, by fine-tuning a large language model.


In (the philosophy of) comparative cognition, I have published a number of thrillers, including:
- [Analogies And The Associative-Cognitive Distinction In Comparative Psychology (forthcoming)](https://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/26165/). *Accepted in Biology & Philosophy*. I provide an account of the distinction between associative learning and cognition in terms of hypothesis generation and analogical reasoning.
- [Morganâ€™s Canon and the Associative-Cognitive Distinction Today: A Survey of Practitioners (2024)](https://psycnet.apa.org/psycarticles/2026-17528-001.pdf). *Accepted in The Journal of Comparative Psychology*. We surveyed 220 comparative psychologists and asked them about the methodological challenges that they face when studying non-human animal cognition.
- [The Future Is Computational Comparative Cognition](https://doi.org/10.3819/ccbr.2024.190009) *Accepted in CCBR*. We argue that comparative cognition needs computational modelling.
- [Replications, comparisons, sampling and the problem of representativeness in animal cognition research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7610843/). We tackle the problems of generalizability and representativeness in empirical animal cognition research.
