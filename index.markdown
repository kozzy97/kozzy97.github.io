His research focuses on building rigorous, cognitively-inspired evaluations of machine learning models, so that we can build better, safer, and more human-like AI, as well as informed and sensible AI policy. To get there, we must use the diverse tools of the cognitive sciences. Konstantinos is a committed interdisciplinarian, with publications and active research projects in machine learning, cognitive psychology, psychometrics, the philosophy of science, evolutionary biology, and linguistics.
