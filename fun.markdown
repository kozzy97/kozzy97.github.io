People say you shouldn't just talk about work if you want to appear :sparkles: *fun* :sparkles:. So here are some of my interests:
- I like learning languages. So far I've tried English (C2+), Mancunian (C2), Greek (C1), French (B2), German(~B1), Mandarin (HSK 3), Turkish (A2), and Liverpudlian (~A2). I once spent a summer learning [Classical Nahuatl](https://nahuatl.thinkific.com/courses/freenahuatl2020). 
- I like doing sports. I somehow managed to represent Cambridge University twice in the so-called *Spare Pairs Race* against Oxford, and I successfully lost both times. Like my approach to research and language-learning, now I do a little of a lot of sports to make sure I don't get very good at any of them.
- I mostly do sports because I like to eat, which means I have to like cooking. It can be fun sometimes, nonetheless.
- I also like to stress myself out by listening to lots of politics podcasts and reading books about history and its long-reaching consequences for contemporary world affairs.

This marks the end of the :sparkles: *fun* :sparkles: section.
